Narcissist is a tool to collect sets of images with which to train image-recognition neural networks.

It uses the *Bing* image search tool to compile images. It runs on the Microsoft Azure cloud.

## FAQ

#### *Is this project going to be useful to my serious neural net research project?*
No, probably not. It uses *Bing* image search to compile the image sets. You will probably want humans to curate your image sets.

#### *Can I train a neural net that I can use with google deepdream to produce trippy images?*
Hopefully, that's the aim of the project anyway. 

#### *Why 'narcissist'?*
It's a bad, convoluted pun. A narcissist is image-conscious. We're using images to train a neural net, a primitive thinking machine... or consciousness, if you will. Sorry, I said it was bad and convoluted.
